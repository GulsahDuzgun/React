### What did I learn while coding this project?

> - _**What is the difference between Client Side Rendering and Server Side Rendering?** Client Side Rendering are used to build Single-Page Applications(SPAs). All HTML is rendered on the client. All HTML is rendered on the client browser so all Javascript needs to be downloaded before apps start running: bad for performance.CSR is good for inernally used applications as tools inside componies. Server Side Rendering is used to build Multi Page Applications(MPAs). Some HTML is rendered in the server. More performant and as less Javascript needs to be downloaded.,_
