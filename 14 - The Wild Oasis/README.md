### What did I learn while coding this project?

> #
>
> - _**What is the difference between Client Side Rendering and Server Side Rendering?** Client Side Rendering are used to build Single-Page Applications(SPAs). All HTML is rendered on the client. All HTML is rendered on the client browser so all Javascript needs to be downloaded before apps start running: bad for performance.CSR is good for inernally used applications as tools inside componies. Server Side Rendering is used to build Multi Page Applications(MPAs). Some HTML is rendered in the server. More performant and as less Javascript needs to be downloaded.,_

- _**What is SUPARBASE?** Supabase is a service that allows developers to easily create a back-end with a Postgres database. Superbase is automatically creates a database and API. So we can easily request and receive data from server where the Postgres database is actually hosted. We don't need to go through with whole back-end process. It also contains complete solution user authentication and file storage. ,_

- _**What is React Query?** React Query is a powerful library for managing remote (server) state which stored on a server and that we need to load into our application. ,_
- _React Query allows us to write a lot less code in order to fetch data an API and manage all that data. All remote state is cached which means that the fetched data will be stored in order to be reused in different points of the application. It provides us to download a bit less data and all other components can receive it instantly. Without having to show the user another loading spinner,_
- _React Query gives us all loading and error states so that we can actually focus on what matters.React Query also automatically re-fetching to keep state synched in certain situations. Like after a certain timeout or after we leave the browser window. ,_
- _Besides refetching we can also prefetch data which basically means to fetch data that we know will become necessary later but before actually displayed on the screen. And a classic example of this is pagination where with prefetching we can fetch data not only for the current page but also for the next page. Updating remote state is very easy with React Query. ,_
- _Offline support with cached data that means even if the user lost its connection, they would move around in the app while being offline ,_
