## Far Away

Far Away is a website which is a user can define their needs for holiday. After the user define their needs and its count, It will be shown up the list below. These needs can be checked as packed. Remain work is shown on footer according this ratio. And specified needs can be order by selecting the option in select menu and can be cleaned with clicking the clear list button.

### What did I learn while coding this project?

> #
>
> - _**What is the difference between State and Props?** State is internal data, owned by component. It is component's memory and can be updated by the component itself. Updating state causes component to re-render. It is used to make components interactive. Props is external data which owned by parent component. Similar to function parameters and it is read-only.Receiving new props causes component to re-render. Usually when the parent's state has been updated. It is used by parent to configure child component. ,_
> - _**What is Derived State?** Derived State is computed from an existing piece of state or from props,_
> - _**What is the children prop?** The children prop allows us to pass JSX into an element. Essential tool to make reusable and configurable components. It useful for generic components that don't know their content before being used. ,_
