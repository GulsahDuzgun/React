### What did I learn while coding this project?

> #
>
> - _**What is Tailwind CSS?** Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center, etc. that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup. ,_
> - _Utility-first CSS approach is writing tiny classes with one single purpose, and then combining them to build entire layouts or Atomic CSS. ,_

- _Tailwind has a design system: many design decisions have been taken for you, which makes UIs look better and more consistent. And while using Tailwind CSS no need to think about class names. No jumping between files to write markup and styles. _
