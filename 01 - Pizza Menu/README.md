### What did I learn while coding this project?

> #
>
> - _**What is React?** React is declarative( telling React what a component should look like based on current data/state), based on components, state-driven (React reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI) extremely popular Javascript library which is created by facebook. ,_
> - React.StrictMode what does is during development renders all components twice in order to find certain bugs. Also React will checkif we are using outdated parts of the React API.
> - _**What are Components?** Components are building blocks of user interfaces in React. React applications are entirely made out of components.Components are piece of UI that has its own data, logic and appearance. Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between them. ,_
> - _**What is JSX?** JSX is declarative syntax to descrive what components look like and how they work, Components must return a block of JSX. JSX is an Javascript extension that allows us to embed Javascript, CSS and React components into HTML. Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement() function call by BABEL. ,_
> - _**What is Props?** Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components(down the component tree). And Props are essential tool to configure and customize components(like function parameters). Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components. ,_
> - _Components made of data, logic, apperance. Data consists of State and Props. Props are read-only and immutable. Props is data coming from the outside, and can only be updated by the parent component. State is internal data that can be updated by the component's logic. If you need to mutate props, you actually need state. ,_
> - _ React has one-way data flow(props) because mutating props(an object) would affect parent's data, creating side effects. Immutable props allows React to avoid bugs and make apps predictable,_
