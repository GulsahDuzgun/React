### What did I learn while coding this project?

> #
>
> - _Most of our components will naturally fall into one of three categories: Stateless/ presentational components, Stateful components, Structural components. ,_
> - _Stateless/ presentational components don't have state, can receive props and simply present received data or other content. They are usually small and reusable. ,_
> - _Stateful components have state and can still be reusable ,_
> - _Structural components results of composition and can be huge and non-reusable such as pages, layouts or screens. ,_
> - _**What is Component Composition?** Component Composition means combining different components using the children prop. We use component composition to create highly reusable and flexible components and fix prop drilling. ,_
