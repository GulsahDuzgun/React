> - _**What is State in React?** State is data that a component can hold over time, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle. We can also say Component's memory for it. ,_
> - Component State: Single local component variable("Piece of state","state variable"). Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component.
> - _State allows developer to update the component's view by re-rendering the component. It provides us to change a part of the UI. Second state allows developers to persist local variables between multiple renders and re-renders. ,_
