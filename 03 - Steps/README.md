### What did I learn while coding this project?

> #
>
> - _**What is State in React?** State is data that a component can hold over time, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle. We can also say Component's memory for it. ,_
> - Component State: Single local component variable("Piece of state","state variable"). Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component.
> - _State allows developer to update the component's view by re-rendering the component. It provides us to change a part of the UI. Second state allows developers to persist local variables between multiple renders and re-renders. ,_
> - _State variable for any data that the component should keep track of ("remember") over time. This is data that will change at some point.In Vanilla JS , that is a let variable or an [ ] or {} ,_
> - _Whenever you want something in the component to be dynamic, create a piece of state related to that 'thing' and update the state when the 'thing' should change. If you want to change the way of component looksi or the data it displays, update its state ,_
> - _When building a component, imagine its view as a reflection of state changing over time. For data that should not trigger component re-renders, don't use state. Use a regular variable instead. ,_
